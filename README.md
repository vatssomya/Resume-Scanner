# üß† Resume Scanner ‚Äì AI-Based Role Predictor
 

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview

The **Resume Scanner** takes a `.pdf`, `.docx`, or `.txt` file, extracts the text, and compares it with predefined job role descriptions to determine the most relevant match.

This project helped build the pipeline for resume parsing, vectorization, and basic classification, which later evolved into the full RecruitGPT system.

Demo video included!
